# Frontend Workflows with AngularJS

Source code for the "Frontend Workflows with Angular JS" screencast I produced on INSERT DATE here.

The goal of this screencast and repository is to highlight how easy it is for web developers to use Grunt (and other tools that leverage Grunt like Lineman and Yeoman) to craft their own workflows. I have had great success working in this way for the last year and have found that these types of workflow tools really enable a clean separation between client/server codebases that even allow developers to keep their respective code for each side in separate repositories.

By watching the screencast you will learn about:

* how to create your own frontend workflow using [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com)
* how to create custom tasks with Grunt
* how to use Lineman, which utilizes Grunt, to create web applications that are completely portable between any backend.
* how to manually bootstrap the application we built in "End-to-End with AngularJS"
* how to effectively separate your code into many small pieces with singular responsibilities
