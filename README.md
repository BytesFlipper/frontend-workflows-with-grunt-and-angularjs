The goal of this screencast and repository is to educate web developers on how to use Grunt to craft their own workflows, and examine a higher level tool that provides some additional features that are helpful when creating rich-client web applications.

By watching the screencast you will learn about:

* how to create your own frontend workflow using [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com)
* how to create custom tasks with Grunt
* how to use [Lineman](http://www.linemanjs.com), which utilizes Grunt, to create web applications that are completely portable between any backend.
* how to manually bootstrap the application we built in "End-to-End with AngularJS"
* how to effectively separate your code into many small pieces with singular responsibilities
