## Laravel Backend

This is the backend from "End-to-End with Angular JS", but stripped of any of the client-side assets as we have moved them into both `with-grunt` and `with-lineman` directories and effectively separated client and server codebases. (I've located them within a single repository so you can just download a single package).

If you need instructions on how to get up and running with Laravel 4 on a Mac, you can find them in the "End-to-End with Angular JS" [README]() file.
